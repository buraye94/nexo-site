The old playbook of building hundreds of low-quality backlinks is dead. Google's algorithms have become sophisticated enough to evaluate link quality with remarkable precision.

## What Works Now

A single link from a high-authority, topically relevant site is worth more than 50 links from generic directories. The math has changed, and your strategy should too.

## Our Approach

We focus on three types of link placements:

**Editorial placements** — Getting mentioned in existing, high-traffic articles on authoritative sites. These require genuine value and relationships.

**Strategic guest contributions** — Not generic guest posts, but thoughtful pieces on industry-specific publications that your target audience actually reads.

**Resource link building** — Creating genuinely useful tools, data, or guides that naturally attract links from relevant sources.

## The Numbers

In our experience, 5-8 high-quality links per month consistently outperform campaigns placing 30+ lower-quality links. The key metrics to watch are referring domain authority, topical relevance, and traffic to the linking page.

Quality link building is slower, more expensive per link, and significantly more effective at moving rankings and driving referral traffic.
