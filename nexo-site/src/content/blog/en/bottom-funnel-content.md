Most businesses start their SEO journey by publishing blog posts. It feels natural — create content, get traffic, convert visitors.

But there's a fundamental problem with this approach: blog traffic is mostly top-of-funnel. These visitors are researching, not buying.

## The Bottom-of-Funnel Advantage

Bottom-of-funnel landing pages target people who are ready to act. They're searching for solutions, comparing options, looking for the best provider.

When you optimize for these high-intent keywords first, every visitor is worth significantly more to your business.

## What This Looks Like in Practice

Instead of writing "What is SEO?" (top of funnel), you create a landing page targeting "SEO consulting services for e-commerce" (bottom of funnel).

The search volume is lower, but the conversion rate can be 10-20x higher.

## The Strategy

1. Identify your highest-value service or product
2. Research bottom-of-funnel keywords with buying intent
3. Create dedicated landing pages optimized for those terms
4. Build authority through targeted link building
5. THEN expand to mid-funnel and top-funnel content

This is how you turn SEO into a revenue channel, not just a traffic source.
